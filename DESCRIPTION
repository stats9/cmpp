Description: Implements parametric (Direct) regression methods for modeling cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) in 
                the presence of competing risks. Methods include the direct Gompertz-based approach 
                and generalized regression models as described in Jeong and Fine (2006) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2006.00532.x> 
                and Jeong and Fine (2007) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxj040>.
                The package facilitates maximum likelihood estimation, variance computation, 
                with applications to clinical trials and survival analysis.
