Description: Implements parametric modeling and regression methods for cumulative incidence functions in 
        the presence of competing risks. Methods include the direct Gompertz-based approach 
        and generalized regression models as described in Jeong and Fine (2006, 2007). 
        The package facilitates maximum likelihood estimation, variance computation, 
        and goodness-of-fit evaluation for competing risks data, 
        with applications to clinical trials and survival analysis.
