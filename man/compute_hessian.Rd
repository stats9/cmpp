\title{Compute the Hessian Matrix of the Log-Likelihood}
\usage{
compute_hessian(Param)
}
\arguments{
\item{Param}{A numeric vector of parameters for which the Hessian matrix is calculated.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix representing the Hessian matrix at the specified parameters.
}
\description{
Calculates the Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function using finite differences.
This function is useful for understanding the curvature of the log-likelihood surface and for optimization purposes.
}
\details{
This function approximates the Hessian matrix using central finite differences.
Ensure that the step size \code{h} is appropriately set during initialization to avoid numerical instability.
The function requires the data to be initialized using \code{Initialize} before being called.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
Param <- c(0.5, 0.1, 0.6, 0.2)
hessian <- compute_hessian(Param)
print(hessian)
}
