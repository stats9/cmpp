\title{Compute the Log-Likelihood for the Model}
\usage{
LogLike1(Param)
}
\arguments{
\item{Param}{A numeric vector of model parameters: \link{alpha1, beta1, alpha2, beta2}, where
the first two are for the first event and the next two are for the second event.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the negative log-likelihood.
}
\description{
Computes the negative log-likelihood of the Cmpp model given parameters and the initialized data.
The log-likelihood considers Gompertz distributions for competing risks.
}
\details{
This function requires the data to be initialized using \code{Initialize} before being called.
The log-likelihood is based on survival probabilities derived from the Gompertz distributions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
Param <- c(0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01)
LogLike1(Param)
}
